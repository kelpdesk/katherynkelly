## üåä Early Life

Beach life was central to my upbringing in the north county coastlines of San Diego, California. I was swimming before I could walk, and my dad would push me into waves until I learned to paddle on my own. Our family often picnicked at La Jolla Cove, listening to the Big Band's patriotic songs and exploring the tidepools teeming with sea critters.

Summers were spent sunbathing at the beach and playing in the surf. I joined Junior Lifeguards and learned to read tides, currents, and swells, while strength training, running safety drills, and competitively playing strategic group games.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technical Aptitude

My technical roots run as deep as my love for the wild. I enjoyed computer games and surfing the early internet ‚Äî always eager to explore. This curiosity sparked an early interest in graphic design.

In elementary school, I excelled in our computer lab, guided by typing lessons and resource management games. Educational games sharpened my reading and arithmetic skills. By middle school, I had started creating my own fantasy art, superimposing butterfly wings onto fashion models to make digital fae. I built my first website to share these creations and joined a network of fairy-themed sites, eager to connect with others who shared the magic.  

In high school, I launched a fan fiction RPG site set in a land of magic and wizardry, collaborating with others to bring our fantasy world to life. This creative pursuit introduced me to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and graphic design. I took a Computer Applications class that covered the Microsoft Office Suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Access. I also dove into a computer programming course.

## üåç Into the Wild

After graduation, I spent several years backpacking, hiking, and camping ‚Äî honoring my early reverence for the ocean by exploring other manifestations of nature. I traversed bioregions across thirty-eight U.S. states. From the Pacific Northwest to the wetlands of the South, the coastlines of New England to the forests of the Midwest and Mountain states, I found hidden gems that challenged the notion that no place could match San Diego's beauty.

I spent a season in Eugene, Oregon, contributing to its Victory Garden. A lovely mentor there introduced me to permaculture concepts that sparked my interest. What I'd learned about nature's systems could be leveraged in cultivating productive landscapes that required little outside resources and reinvesting all of its output into the system.

With a newfound desire to steward the land, I contributed to conservation efforts including landscaping, restoration, fuel reduction, and wildland fire fighting back in San Diego.

## üß† Career Journey

Eventually, I pivoted to office-based work and found myself reinvigorated by technology. What started as temporary desk roles evolved into a ten-year journey across support, logistics, and legal compliance in digital Trust & Safety.

During that time, I continued my education, completing courses in digital media, web design & development, and computer programming.
